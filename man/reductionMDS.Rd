\usage{
reductionMDS(object, eig = FALSE, k = 2, add = FALSE,
  x.ret = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Cookie object}

\item{eig}{Indicates whether eigenvalues should be returned.}

\item{k}{The maximum dimension of the space which the data are to be represented in; must be in {1, 2, â€¦, n-1}.}

\item{add}{Logical indicating if an additive constant c* should be computed, and added to the non-diagonal dissimilarities such that the modified dissimilarities are Euclidean.}

\item{x.ret}{Indicates whether the doubly centred symmetric distance matrix should be returned.}
}
